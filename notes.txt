physics

If you use the built in renderer and and built in runner, with default settings this translates to:

1 position = 1px
1 speed = 1px per step
1 step = 16.666ms @ 60 Hz = 1/60 s

currently our field is 720 px long 
6 in per px
100 yd = 600 px
6 px = 1 yd

assume velocity of 10 yd/sec

velocity = px/step

turn 10 yd/s to px/step

10 yd/s * 6 px/yd * 1/60 s/step
