# Defensive Formation - Formatting Rules

When writing a defensive formation you will have access to the following alignment rules and reference points.

## Coordinate System
All directions (left, right, forward, backward) are based on the players local coordinate system. It assumes the player is facing the line of scrimmage. A defensive player moving left will appear to move to the offenses right. Similarly a defensive player moving backward will be moving away from the line of scrimmage.

## Alignment Rules
The defense can make use of the following concepts to more easily set alignment.

- inside, the edge closest to the ball
- outside, the edge furthest from the ball
- strongside, the side of the defense (left or right) the defense has identified as the strenght of the offense. This is calculated using preferences set by the user.
- weakside, the side of the defense (left or right) opposite the strongside

### Horizontal Alignment Rules
- align (sets the center of the player inline horizontally with the center of a reference)
- apex (centers the player halfway between the centers of two other references)
- left-of (sets the right edge of the player inline with the left edge of a reference)
- right-of (sets the left edge of the player inline with the right edge of a reference)
- inside (sets the outside edge of the player inline with the inside edge of a reference)
- outside (sets the inside edge of the player inline with the outside edge of a reference)
- shade-left (sets the center of the player inline with the left edge of a reference)
- shade-right (sets the center of the player inline with the right edge of a reference)
- shade-in (sets the center of the player inline with the inside edge of a reference)
- shade-out (sets the center of the player inline with the outside edge of a reference)
- shade-strong (sets the center of the player inline with the strongside edge of a reference)
- shade-weak (sets the center of the player inline with the weakside edge of a reference)

### Vertical Alignment Rules
- align (sets the center of the player inline vertically with the center of a reference)
- behind (sets the front edge of the player inline with the back edge of a reference)
