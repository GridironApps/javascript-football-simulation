OLB 
static read the mesh point to get his run/pass read - mesh point is his key - 
    once he gets his read he'll determine what to do 
    - if QB opens up to him he's going to play QCR (Quarterback, Cutback, Reverse), 
    if QB opens away from him he's stepping up to set the edge right now. 
    If drop back he's opening 45 and 
        getting to the hip pocket of the number 1 receiver or 
        widest receiver if 1 cancels inside (flat dropper).
